        <div class="bio">
            <p>Hello. My name is Edris. Background is in IT. I earned my B.S in System Administration and
                Security
                from the University of New Haven. I have worked as an inter for Yale Health and Cisco. I have passion
                for
                coding thought it is the right time to make it a
                career. That's why I am currently enrolled in Code Fellows bootcamp. My goal is to become a Full-Stack
                Python developer by completing the Code Fellows courses 102-401. I decide web development suits me
                better
                because I am an entrepreneur and also instantly seeing what I have built suits my visual learner aspect.
                .</p>
            <p>Some of my interest include, coding, computer/security, soccer and table tennis. I also
                consider myself a
                good cook as I grew up in a family restaurant working as a dishwasher when I was a kid all the way to a
                cook
                by the time I graduated from high school. I also love nature, travelling and learning new languages. In
                addition to that I have great interest in learning about other cultures and I appreciate the different
                tradition/culture among all humanity around the globe.
            </p>
