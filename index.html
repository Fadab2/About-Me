            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Hello. My name is Edris. Background is in IT. I earned my B.S in System Administration and
                Security
                from the University of New Haven. I have worked as an inter for Yale Health and Cisco. I have passion
                for
                coding thought it is the right time to make it a
                career. That's why I am currently enrolled in Code Fellows bootcamp. My goal is to become a Full-Stack
                Python developer by completing the Code Fellows courses 102-401. I decide web development suits me
                better
                because I am an entrepreneur and also instantly seeing what I have built suits my visual learner aspect.
                .</p>
